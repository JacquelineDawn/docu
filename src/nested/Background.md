# Background

The development of artificial intelligence technology is in its very early stages. While deep neural networks have been in use for decades, foundation models like BERT, DALL-E, and GPT-3 have emerged only recently. These models have generated a lot of enthusiasm and speculation due to their enhanced scale and broad adaptability to a wide range of tasks. 

A key characteristic of these models is that their performance scales in proportion of the number of parameters: the larger the model, the more it can do. Achieving this scale, however, is only possible for very few, namely large tech conglomerates, given the computational resources needed. This shortage in computing power, therefore, is one that limits innovation and undermines equity. 

Meanwhile, distributed ledger technology has opened up new possibilities in terms of governance and coordination, offering advantages to every area it is applied to. Specifically, blockchain technology has the potential to align vast amounts of resources in service of a common goal. The way we see it, opening up accessibility to computing power through the use of a decentralized technology offers a potential solution to the above mentioned problem.
