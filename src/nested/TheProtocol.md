# The Protocol

The Bittensor network is designed such that a digital token, Tao, reaches equivalency with the quality and quantity of representational knowledge generated within the system. 

There are two primary types of [nodes](src/../Glossary.md#miner/neuron/peer/node) (alternatively called “miners” or “peers”) that compose the backbone of the economy: [Servers](src/../Glossary.md#servers) and [Validators](src/../Glossary.md#validators). A third type, Client nodes, exist purely to extract knowledge with [Tao](src/../Glossary.md#tao) they have purchased upon [registration](src/../Glossary.md#registration). These three types of network peers compose the dynamic, iterative ecosystem that is Nakamoto - a peer-to-peer network of machine learning models - while the network blockchain, [Subtensor](#), tracks [peer](src/../Glossary.md#miner/neuron/peer/node) activity, processes it, and distributes [tokens](src/../Glossary.md#tao) accordingly.

Upon registration, Servers and Validators are fashioned with a dataset, a model, and two separate wallets to store [inflation](src/../Glossary.md#inflation). Validators pass text data on to Servers in the system, in a tokenized version, and receive a processed format in return, in the form of tensors. Validators will then determine which Server has provided them with most useful “knowledge” and relay these assessments to the network blockchain. 

This iterative process and competition framework is the foundational activity that the entire network is designed to support.
