# Concepts 

Bittensor is a mining network that leverages blockchain computing power to build and deploy machine learning models at scale, incentivized by TAO. The network comprises nodes with unique models that collaborate to analyze text data for insights, incentivized to produce valuable models through a consensus mechanism that equates TAO with knowledge. The network's token-based incentives drive growth and distribute value directly to participants, with no centralized control over access or profits.


**Network / Consensus**

Bittensor's protocol rewards users with TAO tokens for valuable contributions to the network, comprising Servers and Validators. Validators evaluate Server performance and distribute tokens on the network blockchain. Users choose their role and contribute by providing tokenized text and evaluating Server responses. This decentralized approach to collaborative machine learning has diverse applications.

Bittensor's consensus mechanism rewards valuable nodes at an increasing rate, using a consensus algorithm to deter malicious activity. Servers receive rewards by producing valuable knowledge and being useful to the majority of Validators, while Validators are incentivized to collaborate with highly valuable Servers through a bonding mechanism and score restrictions.

**TAO**

TAO is a cryptocurrency that is distributed based on the value of machine intelligence created within the network, as determined by Validators. It is always a representation of real work done, and not pre-mined, airdropped, or minted out of thin air. TAO serves as an incentive for valuable activity and discourages malicious nodes, while also acting as an access token and tradable for governance tokens. The supply of TAO is limited to 21 million, with a four-year halving cycle, and is minted at a constant rate of 1 TAO every 12 seconds. TAO's value is optimized through factors such as the expansion of the network, interaction between models, increased competition, and incentivizing the interaction of the most valuable nodes.

**Delegation**

With the release of Finney network on the Kusunama parachain, Bittensor network introduces a new feature called "Delegation". This feature allows participants to delegate TAO to any hotkey or the Foundation Validator and earn rewards without mining themselves. The delegates collect an 18% share of all emissions from delegated TAO. This new mechanism affects the network's consensus by introducing non-miners' participation in the network. The delegate validators must perform better than their peers to remain competitive while promoting growth and quality in the network. This feature facilitates resource utilization, creating more powerful nodes and enhancing the network's innovative potential. Developers are invited to build their desired features on Bittensor network's Dev Space on the Kusunama Test Net.

**Subnetworks**

Bittensor's Finney Upgrade will allow the creation of subnetworks within the network. Initially, Bittensor focused on the text modality before expanding to other modalities such as image, audio, and video. As the network expands, the methodology of civil resistance adapts to prevent flooding of the network. The Finney Upgrade will introduce a base subnetwork acting as a registration buffer between entrants and the main network. Miners will need to achieve a performance threshold in the base network before advancing to the main network. The Finney Upgrade introduces the ability to create incentive subnetworks of different modalities. Bittensor seeks to build subnetworks with tensor standardization, which creates a common representation of tensors between subnetworks with different modalities. Zero-Shot learning can be used in conjunction with tensor standardization, allowing subnetworks of new modalities to learn from already robust subnetworks of other modalities on Bittensor.
